BackboneTests
=============

These are two applications built as a Backbone learning process. 

The Todo application was a tutorial courtesy of http://adrianmejia.com/blog/2012/09/11/backbone-dot-js-for-absolute-beginners-getting-started/

The BattleDots application was built using the Todo as a reference. It pits a player versus the computer. Whoever finds the other's four dots first wins!
